	Celes was made in Godot for the GameDev Técnico's Coffee'n Jam. The theme of the jam was "Divided".
</p>
<p>
	In this game, you controll two characters simultaneously. They are controlled by the very same keys, so you cannot move one without moving the other. Each level presents a puzzle or a platforming challenge.
</p>
<p>
	My work here was primarly level design. There are 20 levels to play, in increasing complexity. I tried to have the level progression teach the player how to think when it came to solving our puzzles.
	It was a very interesting game to make, balancing it between puzzle and platforming, while trying to make levels challenging without being too hard. (I might have failed on this last endeavour on the very last level.)
</p>
<p>
	I also did some shader work on the filter that inverted the colours on the lower half of the screen, as well as the wavy thingy that makes the split.
</p>
<p>
	One unfortunate thing about the game is that the FMOD plugin we used was not the most stable. It did not support web builds, and it breaks completely on some pcs, so some players were unable to have audio.
