	My Master's thesis saw me designing and implementing a system to procedurally generate social scenarios that could be solved by the player, using as base 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Raven%27s_bases_of_power"> Franch and Raven's bases of power</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Aditionnaly, I also had to build a game in which to test that system, which posed all sort of challenges both in terms of implementation and in terms of design.
</p>
<p>
	As the solution to each scenario could be represented as a graph of actions the player would take, the problem became one of graph generation, for which I implemented an algorithm that would first build a tree, then connect loose leafs to ensure that all nodes belonged to a path between the starting node and then end node.
</p>
<p>
	Part of the challenge was also building a system that was flexible. The generation algorithm was required to be completely decoupled from the in-game logic. As a result, everything that the generator expected to happened, namely the consequences of the player's actions needed to also be generated and written to the .json file.
